# Evil Text Editor

This is my simple text editor, made evil and inconvenient.
Please do not open important files with this app.
## Basic Text Editor Features
It comes with Open, Save, Save as, Undo, Redo, Print, etc. But please, do not open important files with this app.

## Unpleasant and Random Themes
You've heard of Dark/Light mode, however, I have come up with two new modes: Unpleasant and Random.

## Ants
The app in infested with ants. Every keystroke has a chance to spawn an ant randomly in your file.

## Randomised padding
Nothing comes for granted. All of the buttons are unalinged.

## Language Support
Like any good app, multiple languages are supported. The app is fully translated into American English, English English, Cat, and Alien.

## Critical Hits
Occasionally, a letter you type will critically hit! This will make that letter bigger.

## Printing
Printing is already evil enough, so this feature works as normal.

## Day/Night Cycle
The ants will go to sleep, however, an enemy will take its place and changing the app to the dark/night theme. The ants will come back during the day though.
